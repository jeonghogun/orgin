### **Round 1: Data and Schema Integrity Verification (Completed)**

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 08:46
    *   **Action:** Began Round 1. Inspected Alembic migration `a59e5b13d13d_...` and `00dbc3f6a941_...`.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed claims of dialect-compatibility in the existing documentation are **verified**.

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 08:46 - 09:02
    *   **Action:** Attempted to install dependencies.
    *   **Finding:** The `pip install` command repeatedly timed out.
    *   **Fix:** Successfully installed all dependencies by breaking them into smaller, logical batches.

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:02 - 09:03
    *   **Action:** Attempted to run `alembic check`. Performed a manual fallback check.
    *   **Finding (CRITICAL):** Discovered that ORM models are out of sync with the database schema (`MessageVersion`, `UserFact`, `SummaryNote` models are missing). This is scheduled to be fixed.

### **Round 2: API, Service Logic, & Test Suite Audit (Completed)**

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:04
    *   **Action:** Audited security configurations (`settings.py`, `admin.py`, `main.py`).
    *   **Finding:** Verified that `AUTH_OPTIONAL` defaults to `False`, the admin API is protected, and the CORS policy is hardened.
    *   **Fix:** Identified and refactored a redundant dependency pattern in `admin.py` for clarity.

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:06
    *   **Action:** Audited core AI logic in `app/tasks/review_tasks.py`.
    *   **Finding:** Verified that the fault-tolerance (OpenAI fallback) and token-saving (summarization) features are correctly implemented as documented.

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:06
    *   **Action:** Verified existence of test files `test_config.py` and `test_review_tasks.py`.

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:07 - 09:12
    *   **Action:** Ran the unit test suite, which initially had 4 failing tests.
    *   **Fix:** Debugged and fixed all 4 failures. This involved:
        1.  Creating two missing Pydantic models (`CreateReviewRoomInteractiveResponse`, `LLMQuestionResponse`) to fix an initial `ImportError`.
        2.  Resolving a circular import between `review_service.py` and `dependencies.py` by moving an import to be local to a function.
        3.  Correcting the test setup in `test_config.py` to handle module reloading and environment variables properly.
        4.  Fixing a typo in a mock assertion in `test_storage_service.py`.
        5.  Refactoring the mock `side_effect` in `test_review_tasks.py` to prevent unwanted Celery retries.
    *   **Outcome:** The unit test suite is now **100% passing**.

### **Round 3: Frontend Interaction Verification (Completed)**

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:12
    *   **Action:** Performed static code analysis on frontend components.
    *   **Finding:** Verified that `Review.jsx` uses a `useEventSource` hook for SSE and `ChatInput.jsx` uses `fetch` with a streaming reader. The real-time features are implemented as claimed.

*   **Timestamp:** 2025-09-15 09:13
    *   **Action:** Searched for `alert()` calls in the frontend source code.
    *   **Finding:** No instances of `alert()` were found in `app/frontend/src`. One instance was found in a minified build artifact in `app/static`, which is believed to be from a stale build.
